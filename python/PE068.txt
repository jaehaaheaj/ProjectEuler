# sum of all five lines is (1+2+...+10) + sum(inside_ring)
# min(sum) is easily derived from eq. above : (1+2+...+10)+(1+2+3+4+5) = 55+15 = 70, with inside ring containing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# if max solution set starts with 6-5-....., then it's global maxima, and it exists; 6, 5, 3; 10, 3, 1; 9, 1, 4; 8, 4, 2; 7, 2, 5
